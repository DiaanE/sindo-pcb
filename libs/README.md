# Note

This folder holds all the local parts and schematics for custom keyboard components. Some of these are proprietary so I can't share all the contents. The below list contains the sources of all open source libs that were downloaded and placed inside this directory on my personal computer. I am personally not a huge fan of git submodules, but feel free to add these as submodules if that suits your personal preference.
